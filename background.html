<p>Throughout my geologist and GIS analyst career, I've diligently cultivated a diverse skill set through practical experiences and continuous learning. My journey began with hands-on fieldwork, where I honed my ability to thrive in various weather conditions, data collection, and acquiring a deep understanding of geological processes and their real-world implications. My technical skills extend to proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite applications, expertise in using open-source software, and a mastery of Esri products such as ArcMap for geospatial analysis and mapping. I've also developed solid report-writing abilities, enabling me to convey complex findings effectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my analytical and problem-solving capabilities have been crucial in tackling intricate geological and GIS challenges. My adaptability shines as I've navigated through some projects, demonstrating the versatility and flexibility the field demands. But it's not just about technical aptitude; my journey has also nurtured vital soft skills. My experience has cultivated assertive communication, ensuring I can articulate my findings and recommendations clearly and confidently. This skill, my ability to collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, and my dedication to ongoing professional development have proven invaluable throughout my career.</p>

<p>This is the technical report of the pilot project for mapping surface geological units and geomorphological subunits conducted in the northern region of the Bolivar department, as Phase I of the detailed-scale hazard zoning to be carried out in Colombia. The project was developed in a special agreement with the Colombian Geological Survey, which provided project guidance and technical supervision in collaboration with the Corporation of the Canal del Dique and the Colombian Caribbean Observatory.</p>
