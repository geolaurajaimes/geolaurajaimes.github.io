	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I am a geologist with a focus on assertive communication, critical thinking, and adaptability. My specialization lies in geological, engineering geological, and geomorphological mapping, along with practical applications of GIS technology. I have a proven proficiency in identifying and characterizing natural hazards such as floods, flash floods, and landslides and assessing their impact on the population.</p>
	<p>You can learn more about my professional journey as a seasoned geologist and GIS specialist by visiting my LinkedIn profile. Additionally, I invited you to explore my skills and background section to understand better my passion for geosciences and GIS applied to significant projects in various regions of Colombia.</p>
	<p>I completed my geology degree at the Industrial University of Santander (Colombia) and have a robust background in GIS, which is strengthening with my current formation as a GIS Specialist at Fleming College.</p>
	<p>Over the years, I've been involved in a range of investigation projects, including engineering geological and geomorphological mapping, landslide susceptibility zonation, flood and flash flood hazard zonation, urban cadaster planning, and environmental consulting for both public and private sectors. I am also eligible to become a GIT.</p>
